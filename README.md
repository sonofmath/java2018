Created our class where speaking is the shared resource:

## Android Studio HW - Factorial Calculator
https://github.com/sonofmath/java2018/tree/master/androidHW
```
Factorial calculator that works but doesn't output correctly for larger numbers.
Would have liked to convert to scientific notation if the output got a certain number of digits long.
